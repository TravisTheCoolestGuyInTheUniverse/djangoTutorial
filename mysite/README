Remaking my notes since i didn't push my code to github like a doofus:

Django is powerful because it forces its users to develop websites in an optimal way:
it forces the website to be scaleable and efficient. Other web frameworks give you more 
flexability and an ability to see what's happening under the hood however they also allow 
their users to do things however they want even if it is sub-optimal. 

A project in Django is composed of one or more web-applications. For example, there could be an 
application for a home page, another for a store page, ect. This makes the projects more scalable.

models in a django project are described as 

**** USEFUL COMMANDS ****

django-admin startproject [project name]
py manage.py startapp [app name]
py manage.py runserver (development server)
django-admin makemigrations (preps up database, useful for when you first make your models)
django-admin migrate (actually moves data to the database)

to test the database directly without using forms and stuff: 

py manage.py shell
from main.models import User (or other db model)
newUser = User(userName="name" [, fill in other columns])
newUser.save() (commit the changes)
User.objects.all() (print all the objects)
(note that you can also iterate over the objects in the database)
to delete a single entry in a table: 
SomeModel.objects.filter(id=id).delete()
